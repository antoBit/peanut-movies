# Peanut Technical Challenge

![CleanShot 2022-02-23 at 14 53 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22414962/155338320-7207b014-ddbb-41d0-8b2a-e84665fa8186.jpg)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Some of the libraries I used are:

-   `axios` for API calls
-   `he` to parse some of the API service responses that were passed as encoded HTML entities (i.e. `Schindler&aposList`)

For the sake of writing this app fast I decided to use [Open Props](https://open-props.style/) which is a collection of ready-to-use CSS variables and utilities (like a built-in light/dark theme), but I didn't use anything that I couldn't be able to write myself :)

## App Structure

The app consist of four main parts:

1. routes
2. components
3. hooks
4. api
